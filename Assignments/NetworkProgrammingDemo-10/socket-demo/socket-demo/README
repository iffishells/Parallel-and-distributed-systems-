The folder contains two **network applications** -

1. A file transfer over TCP — server transfers an image file to client, which is displayed on the terminal.

2. A DNS server using UDP — client sends the domain name to server and server returns back IPs.

To run these programs do following -

1. ./compile.sh — this will create 4 binaries — dns_server, dns_client, file_transfer_server, file_transfer_client

2. Run the server — ./file_transfer_server OR ./dns_server

3. Run the client — ./file_transfer_client <IP address of server> OR ./dns_client <IP address of server>
If server and client are running on the same machine, just use “localhost” as server IP address.
